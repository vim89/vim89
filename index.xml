&lt;h1 id="-intro--data-engineering-at-scale-the-real-deal">🧠 Intro – Data Engineering at Scale: The Real Deal&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Forget the buzzwords and “intro to Spark” tutorials. Real Data Engineering at scale is a beast that chews through naïve
assumptions, burns your cloud credits, and laughs at your YAML configs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This blog isn’t a primer. It’s a battle-tested story—how we built a cloud-native SDK in Scala on GCP to tame petabyte
lakes, orchestrate CDC without ACID, and whisper to partitions so you only scan what &lt;em>actually&lt;/em> changed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>llm4s.g8 – A Developer experience boost for LLM4S SDK (Issue #94)</title><link>https://vitthalmirji.com/2025/07/llm4s.g8-a-developer-experience-boost-for-llm4s-sdk-issue-%2394/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vitthalmirji.com/2025/07/llm4s.g8-a-developer-experience-boost-for-llm4s-sdk-issue-%2394/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="-background">🎯 Background&lt;/h2>

&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of software development, where artificial intelligence and language models are reshaping how we build applications, the &lt;strong>LLM4S SDK&lt;/strong> stands out as a powerful toolkit for Scala developers eager to harness the potential of large language models. However, as with many sophisticated tools, the initial onboarding experience can often feel like navigating a labyrinth without a map.

the &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/community/experts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google Developer Expert (GDE)&lt;/a>

it takes. I’ve walked that path. This post is a no-BS breakdown of my journey, including what worked, what didn’t, and
what surprised me along the way.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For me, GDE wasn’t about a title - it was about &lt;strong>recognizing and amplifying&lt;/strong> the work I was already doing. I’ve been
in the engineering game for 12+ years - data pipelines, architecture, tooling, open source, mentoring - and the GDE
program felt like a natural next step to formalize those contributions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DQ Is Not Dairy Queen: Building My Own Data Quality Framework</title><link>https://vitthalmirji.com/2025/07/dq-is-not-dairy-queen-building-my-own-data-quality-framework/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vitthalmirji.com/2025/07/dq-is-not-dairy-queen-building-my-own-data-quality-framework/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="-dq--ice-cream">🍦 DQ ≠ Ice Cream&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When someone hears “DQ Framework,” I get asked if it comes with sprinkles. It doesn’t. It comes with sanity-saving data
validations, automatable quality checks, and opinionated constraints that don’t melt under pressure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So no, this isn’t about Dairy Queen. But it &lt;em>does&lt;/em> prevent frozen pipelines. ❄️&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="-why-i-built-it">💡 Why I Built It&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Every data engineer has been there:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A critical job runs on time&amp;hellip; and writes garbage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Downstream dashboards look suspiciously optimistic.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stakeholders smile because they don’t know 18% of yesterday’s rows are NULL.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I couldn’t keep slapping &lt;code>WHERE col IS NOT NULL&lt;/code> forever. So I built a reusable, testable &lt;strong>Data Quality Framework&lt;/strong> (
DQF) and paired it with a &lt;strong>Declarative Pipeline Assurance Tool&lt;/strong> (DPAT).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scala Meets Data Engineering: Functional Tools I Wish Existed</title><link>https://vitthalmirji.com/2025/06/scala-meets-data-engineering-functional-tools-i-wish-existed/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vitthalmirji.com/2025/06/scala-meets-data-engineering-functional-tools-i-wish-existed/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="-i-got-tired-of-repeating-myself-so-i-wrote-scala-code-that-repeats-me-better-than-i-do">🔁 &amp;ldquo;I got tired of repeating myself.

&lt;li>😓 Manual rollbacks, dashboards showing stale or missing data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>👎 Frustrated teams notifying stakeholders (and me) daily&lt;/li>
&lt;li>🕒 A few hours lost per incident, every day&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Clear ownership via data contracts&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;em>This article will talk about how organizations can make use of the wonderful thing that is commonly referred to as
“Data Lake” - what constitutes a Data Lake, how probably should (and shouldn’t) use it to gather insights and why
evaluating technologies is just as important as understanding your data.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When organizations talk about the need to utilize data as part of their IT and business strategy, they usually have
certain goals in mind. A common question usually boils down to “How can we make use of the data that we have available
within our organization?”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Update an HBase table with Hive or sed</title><link>https://vitthalmirji.com/2016/09/update-an-hbase-table-with-hive-or-sed/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vitthalmirji.com/2016/09/update-an-hbase-table-with-hive-or-sed/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>This article explains how to edit a structured number of records in HBase by combining Hive on M/R2 and sed - and how
to do it properly with Hive.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>HBase&lt;/strong> is an impressive piece of software - massively scalable, super-fast and built upon Google&amp;rsquo;s BigTable&amp;hellip; and if
anyone knows &amp;ldquo;How To Big Data&amp;rdquo;, it ought to be these guys.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But whether you are new to HBase or just never felt the need, working with it&amp;rsquo;s internals tends not to be the most
trivial task. The HBase shell is only slightly better in terms of usability than the infamous zkcli (Zookeeper Command
Line Interface) and once it comes to &lt;strong>editing records&lt;/strong>, you&amp;rsquo;ll wind up with tedious, long and complex statements
before you revert to using it&amp;rsquo;s (Java) API to fulfill your needs - if the mighty Kerberos doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop you before.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://vitthalmirji.com/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vitthalmirji.com/about/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey there - I’m Vitthal 👋&lt;/p>
