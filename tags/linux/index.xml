&lt;p>One question I do get in earnest quite frequently is why I put up with running GNU/Linux distributions for development
work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article aims to clear some of the confusion, without getting lost in technical details or long ramblings about the
shortcomings of &lt;code>systemd&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will also refrain from comparing it to &lt;code>Windows&lt;/code> too much - I use &lt;code>Windows&lt;/code> for video games and am sure that with
modern &lt;code>Powershell&lt;/code>, some of the things I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about are covered there as well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Goodbye, WordPress - Hello, Hugo &amp; nginx</title><link>https://vitthalmirji.com/2020/05/goodbye-wordpress-hello-hugo-nginx/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vitthalmirji.com/2020/05/goodbye-wordpress-hello-hugo-nginx/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For the past 4 or so years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using WordPress to push content to this blog. I originally chose it because my
knowledge of anything to do with Web and Mobile Development is spotty at best - and because &amp;ldquo;back in the day&amp;rdquo;™, it was
the only CMS I was somewhat familiar with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve seen the sluggish mess that the blog is - and today, we&amp;rsquo;ll change it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A look at Apache Hadoop in 2019</title><link>https://vitthalmirji.com/2019/07/a-look-at-apache-hadoop-in-2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vitthalmirji.com/2019/07/a-look-at-apache-hadoop-in-2019/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at whether Apache Hadoop still a viable option in 2019, with Cloud driven data
processing an analytics on the rise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I first started using the Apache Hadoop Ecosystem, things around the magic buzzwords of “Big Data” and “Machine
Learning” were quite different compared to what happened since. In this article, we will take a look at what happened
since and how it compares against powerful, managed Cloud providers in 2019.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
