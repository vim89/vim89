&lt;p>Inventory decisions are where strategy meets survival. Demand forecasting isn&amp;rsquo;t just a data science problem—it&amp;rsquo;s the heartbeat of retail, logistics, and supply chain optimization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post tells the story of how we built a modular, scalable &lt;strong>Demand Forecasting Platform&lt;/strong> that uses &lt;strong>Random Forest&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>Artificial Neural Networks&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>Hybrid Time Series models&lt;/strong>—all running on top of a robust &lt;strong>Data Lake&lt;/strong> infrastructure powered by &lt;strong>Apache Hadoop&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Spark&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data Lakes: Some thoughts on Hadoop, Hive, HBase, and Spark</title><link>https://vitthalmirji.com/2017/11/data-lakes-some-thoughts-on-hadoop-hive-hbase-and-spark/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vitthalmirji.com/2017/11/data-lakes-some-thoughts-on-hadoop-hive-hbase-and-spark/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>This article will talk about how organizations can make use of the wonderful thing that is commonly referred to as
“Data Lake” - what constitutes a Data Lake, how probably should (and shouldn’t) use it to gather insights and why
evaluating technologies is just as important as understanding your data.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When organizations talk about the need to utilize data as part of their IT and business strategy, they usually have
certain goals in mind. A common question usually boils down to “How can we make use of the data that we have available
within our organization?”&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
