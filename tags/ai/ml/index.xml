the &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/community/experts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google Developer Expert (GDE)&lt;/a>
 program - or at least curious what
it takes. Iâ€™ve walked that path. This post is a no-BS breakdown of my journey, including what worked, what didnâ€™t, and
what surprised me along the way.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For me, GDE wasnâ€™t about a title - it was about &lt;strong>recognizing and amplifying&lt;/strong> the work I was already doing. Iâ€™ve been
in the engineering game for 12+ years - data pipelines, architecture, tooling, open source, mentoring - and the GDE
program felt like a natural next step to formalize those contributions.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
