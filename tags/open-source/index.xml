&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of software development, where artificial intelligence and language models are reshaping how we build applications, the &lt;strong>LLM4S SDK&lt;/strong> stands out as a powerful toolkit for Scala developers eager to harness the potential of large language models. However, as with many sophisticated tools, the initial onboarding experience can often feel like navigating a labyrinth without a map. This was precisely the challenge highlighted in &lt;strong>Issue #94&lt;/strong> on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/94" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">llm4s GitHub repo&lt;/a>

the &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/community/experts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google Developer Expert (GDE)&lt;/a>
 program - or at least curious what
it takes. I’ve walked that path. This post is a no-BS breakdown of my journey, including what worked, what didn’t, and
what surprised me along the way.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="-why-i-chose-the-gde-path">🧭 Why I Chose the GDE Path&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For me, GDE wasn’t about a title - it was about &lt;strong>recognizing and amplifying&lt;/strong> the work I was already doing. I’ve been
in the engineering game for 12+ years - data pipelines, architecture, tooling, open source, mentoring - and the GDE
program felt like a natural next step to formalize those contributions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DQ Is Not Dairy Queen: Building My Own Data Quality Framework</title><link>https://vitthalmirji.com/2025/07/dq-is-not-dairy-queen-building-my-own-data-quality-framework/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vitthalmirji.com/2025/07/dq-is-not-dairy-queen-building-my-own-data-quality-framework/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="-dq--ice-cream">🍦 DQ ≠ Ice Cream&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When someone hears “DQ Framework,” I get asked if it comes with sprinkles. It doesn’t. It comes with sanity-saving data
validations, automatable quality checks, and opinionated constraints that don’t melt under pressure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So no, this isn’t about Dairy Queen. But it &lt;em>does&lt;/em> prevent frozen pipelines. ❄️&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="-why-i-built-it">💡 Why I Built It&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Every data engineer has been there:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A critical job runs on time&amp;hellip; and writes garbage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Downstream dashboards look suspiciously optimistic.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stakeholders smile because they don’t know 18% of yesterday’s rows are NULL.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I couldn’t keep slapping &lt;code>WHERE col IS NOT NULL&lt;/code> forever. So I built a reusable, testable &lt;strong>Data Quality Framework&lt;/strong> (
DQF) and paired it with a &lt;strong>Declarative Pipeline Assurance Tool&lt;/strong> (DPAT).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scala Meets Data Engineering: Functional Tools I Wish Existed</title><link>https://vitthalmirji.com/2025/06/scala-meets-data-engineering-functional-tools-i-wish-existed/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vitthalmirji.com/2025/06/scala-meets-data-engineering-functional-tools-i-wish-existed/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="-i-got-tired-of-repeating-myself-so-i-wrote-scala-code-that-repeats-me-better-than-i-do">🔁 &amp;ldquo;I got tired of repeating myself. So I wrote Scala code that repeats me better than I do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Growing up in data engineering, I constantly saw the same patterns: filter, map, explode, transform—not once, but dozens
of times across projects. I realized I needed tools that were like helpers on speed dial. Enter the &lt;strong>Data Engineering
Functional Extensions&lt;/strong> I built and shared on GitHub.&lt;/p>
