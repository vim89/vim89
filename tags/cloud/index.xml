&lt;p>Forget the buzzwords and “intro to Spark” tutorials. Real Data Engineering at scale is a beast that chews through naïve
assumptions, burns your cloud credits, and laughs at your YAML configs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This blog isn’t a primer. It’s a battle-tested story—how we built a cloud-native SDK in Scala on GCP to tame petabyte
lakes, orchestrate CDC without ACID, and whisper to partitions so you only scan what &lt;em>actually&lt;/em> changed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A look at Apache Hadoop in 2019</title><link>https://vitthalmirji.com/2019/07/a-look-at-apache-hadoop-in-2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vitthalmirji.com/2019/07/a-look-at-apache-hadoop-in-2019/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at whether Apache Hadoop still a viable option in 2019, with Cloud driven data
processing an analytics on the rise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I first started using the Apache Hadoop Ecosystem, things around the magic buzzwords of “Big Data” and “Machine
Learning” were quite different compared to what happened since. In this article, we will take a look at what happened
since and how it compares against powerful, managed Cloud providers in 2019.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
